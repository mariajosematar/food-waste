# This code schedules a notification for each item in the inventory collection that is close to its expiration date (within two days). 
# The send_notification function is called with the food item name as an argument when the notification is triggered. 
# In this example, the notification is simply printed to the console, but you could replace this with code to send 
# a notification through email, SMS, or another channel.
